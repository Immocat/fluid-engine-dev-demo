# Fluid Engine Dev - Demo

This repository contains demo scene files that I used for generating [Jet Framework demo](http://fluidenginedevelopment.org/examples/) and example figures for my book, [Fluid Engine Development](http://fluidenginedevelopment.org). The scene files are based on [Mitsuba 0.5.0](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org).
